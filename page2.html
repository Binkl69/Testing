<p>I'm new to software design and I'm creating and learing new things everyday. <br><a href="https://github.com/Binkl69">This is my github</a> <strong> and if you feel like it, have a look at my work</strong>,
it means a lot to me and makes me feel like someone else cares about my journey. <br><em>My wish is to create things that I love and hopefully the world are going to love them too</em></p>
