        <h1>Css Selectors!</h1>
        <h2>An important thing to know</h2>

        <P class="intro">CSS selectors are an important part of coding and the more I get into coding the more I want to create things that bring an actual. I'm learning from Kevin Powell, so let me write what he has in order for all this to make senes to me. So write now we have <a href="https://google.com" class="important-link">google</a> and he has another link or shall I say <a href="#">pseudo link</a>. As I wrote the link, I noticed that it doesn't look nice to look at to have a link at the end of a paragraph so I'm adding some filler text aka this text. Now that's better.</P> 


        <div class="body-text">
    <p>Powell wrote some body text and added another pseudo link but what I'll do is add a real link to maybe <a href="https://amazon.com">amazon</a> website just to have variety</p>

    <p> Another paragraph inside the div with a link that has a class <a href="https://cats.com" class="important-link">Join the Cats!</a> and this is some filler text</p>

    <h1>HTML Lists</h1>
    <h2>How to use and style them</h2>
    <p>We have 2 types of lists in HTMl and CSS, an ordered list and unordered list, or numberd lists or bullets lists. ordered list markup is "ol" and we put "li" or list item inside it, "ul" markup is unordered list </p>

    <ol> <!-- Ordered list -->
        <li>Item number 1</li>
        <li>Item number 2</li>
        <li>Item number 3</li>
        <li>Item number 4</li>
        <li>Item number 5</li>
    </ol>

    <ul> <!-- unordered list -->
        <li>Item number 1</li>
        <li>Item number 2</li>
        <li>Item number 3</li>
        <li>Item number 4</li>
        <li>Item number 5</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="tiny"> <!-- unordered list -->
        <li>Item number 1</li>
        <li>Item number 2</li>
        <li>Item number 3</li>
        <li>Item number 4</li>
        <li>Item number 5</li>
    </ul>
