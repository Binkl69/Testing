    <p>Amrouche was the daughter of Fadhma Aïth Mansour Amrouche; 
        she was the only sister in a family of six sons and was born after the family had moved to Tunisia to escape persecution
         after their conversion to Roman Catholicism. Despite this exile, both she and her brother Jean returned to Algeria for extended visits.
          Through her mother’s influence she became interested in the rich oral traditions of the Kabyle Berber people. 
          In 1934 she obtained her brevet supérieur in Tunis, 
          and in the following year she went to France for studies at the École Normale at Sèvres.
           She worked briefly as an assistant at a boarding school in Radès. Starting in 1936, in collaboration with Jean and her mother, 
           Amrouche collected and began to interpret Kabyle songs. In 1937–38 she presented her repertoire in Paris and in Munich. 
        At the Congrès de Chant de Fès in 1939 she received a scholarship to study at the Casa Velasquez in Spain, where she researched the ties between Berber and Spanish popular songs.
